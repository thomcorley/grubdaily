summary: This is an excellent winter meal, combining a classic Scottish ingredient with fresh fish and generous amount of butter

introduction:
  - "The neep (aka swede) is a classic Scottish ingredient most commonly associated with _haggis neeps and tatties_, the national dish. For this famous dish it's usually blended or crushed to a pulp with butter – much the same as one would make mashed potato – and it's really nice like this; the butter compliments the sweetness of the neeps, which are surprisingly sweet when cooked. I do, however, think it's underrated as an ingredient to be used in many other ways."
  - "Restaurant Mark Greenaway, one of the places I worked, used to serve _confit neeps_. The neeps were cut into chunky oblongs and then slowly cooked in clarified butter. They were served simply with a fillet of hake topped with a herb crust. My version of hake-with-neeps is an improvement on Mark's version, I think, because I sauteed the confit neeps before serving, to bring some vital caramelisation to the party. Combined with the crunchy skin of the pan fried hake, I think you'll agree it's pretty excellent!"
  - "As for the sauce, brown butter (beurre noisette) is an easy option for any kind of fish, and something I often turn to. It ended up being almost a _sauce grenobloise_ after I added chopped lemon and capers. I finished the garnish with some cavolo nero and brown shrimp."
