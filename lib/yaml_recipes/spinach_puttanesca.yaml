summary: An bold take on the Italian classic, Pasta Puttanesca

introduction:
  - "Two things I've always been very fond of: 1) Pasta, and 2) bold, powerful flavours. Pasta puttanesca combines these two things in glorious fashion, so it's no surprise that it will almost certainly make it to my list of all time favourite pasta dishes."
  - "This dish may not look much, but trust me, it packs a punch. Technically, this recipe isn't really a true puttanesca (I have a [previous post](https://www.grubdaily.com/pasta_puttanesca) where you can find a more traditional recipe). This one is a bastardized version of sorts, where tomatoes have been switched for spinach. The combination of spinach, anchovies and garlic is not a new one – these would be perfect accompaniments to a roast leg of lamb, for example, so it makes sense that this is a tasty combination for a pasta dish too."
  - "This puttanesca is strong and powerful, so it goes best with a chunky pasta like rigatoni, but you can use whichever you like."

first_ingredient_set:
  INSERT_TITLE:
    - 190g pasta, preferably rigatoni
    - 2 large handfuls of spinach, roughly chopped
    - 1 tsp capers, chopped
    - 4 fillets anchovies, roughly chopped
    - 2 large cloves garlic, finely sliced or chopped
    - 1/2 tsp arbol chilli flakes
    - 1/2 tsp chipotle chilli flakes
    - 2 tsp butter
    - parmesan cheese, for serving
    - extra virgin olive oil, for cooking
    - sea salt and cracked black pepper

method_steps:
  - "Get a large pot of water boiling for the pasta. Season the water, then add the pasta, removing it when about 1 minute from being cooked. _Remember to reserve the cooking water as you will need it for making the sauce_."
  - "Heat about 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large heavy-based pan over a medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the garlic along with a pinch of salt. Stir once, and cook for 20 seconds before adding the chilli flakes. Turn the heat to low and simmer gently for  2 minutes. Add the spinach, and stir-and-fry until wilted."
  - "When the pasta is drained, add it to the pan with the spinach along with a ladleful of the starchy cooking liquid. Add the capers, anchovies and butter at this point, along with a generous pinch of cracked black pepper. Mix everything together vigorously for a couple of minutes – the pasta will finish cooking and some of its starch will be released into the water to thicken it. Add more of the cooking water if it's getting too thick."
  - "Serve in bowls immediately, with grated parmesan on top."
