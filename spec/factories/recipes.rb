    title "Onion Soup"
    summary "This is a rich and hearty soup from the classic French repertoire. It's one of my favourites."
    introduction "I’ve become quite fond of black beans. I’ve starting substituting them for kidney beans in chilli con carne, fajitas and other Mexican favourites. Also, one of my favourite Madhur Jaffrey recipes is a South African red kidney bean curry; it’s a simple but amazingly delicious recipe that impresses me every time I make it. I tried making it with black beans instead of kidney beans and it was even better! I’m not sure exactly what it is about these beans that makes me like them so much. I suspect it may have something to do with the fact that my all-time favourite meal from my local Chinese restaurant is beef and black bean sauce. It’s an umami-rich delight. For this dish, I think they ferment the beans which makes them extra flavorsome. Fermented or not, I believe black beans actually have a deeper, more savory flavour than most other beans.This recipe is a really simple, easy dish that’s perfect as a weekend breakfast or brunch. Nothing more than onion, garlic and some cumin accompany the stewed beans; and to top the egg I have scattered over some rustic chopped coriander and a squeeze of lime. I like to fry the egg until it’s golden and crispy around the edges. It’s a fairly quick recipe; only about 50 minutes of cooking time, however, remember to soak your beans overnight first!"
